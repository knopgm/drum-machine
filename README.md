# Mini Project - Drum-Machine

Thanks for checking out the repo of this mini project.

This is a fun mini project from [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) which asks you to create some sort of Drum Pad Machine Pad to play drums.

It was a good practice for event listeners, callback functions, and handle animations with the [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library.
